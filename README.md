This mod adds in Sand, Gravel, and Concrete powder blocks that do not fall. So they can be placed like any other block. Mainly intended for decoration purposes. These blocks do not generate in world you have to craft them in order to use them.

Crafting recipes are simple just place the normal block in a crafting grid to get the NoFall version. You can also swap back to the original version by placing the NoFall block back into a crafting grid.

The blocks should act like they normally would except they no longer are affected by gravity so they do not fall. They look and sound just like the normal blocks and the concrete powder will still turn to concrete if it comes in contact with water.
