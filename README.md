This mod adds in Sand, Gravel, and Concrete powder blocks that will no longer fall from gravity. So they can be placed in the air like any other block or have blocks removed from under neath and they will stay right were they are. This mod is intended for decoration / building purposes therefor these blocks do not naturally generate in world you have to craft them in order to use them.

Crafting recipes are simple, just place the vanilla version of the block in a crafting grid to get the NoFall version. You can also craft it back to the original version by placing the NoFall block back into a crafting grid.

The blocks look and feel just like the vanilla blocks normally would, except they no longer are affected by gravity so they do not fall. The concrete powder will still turn to concrete if it comes in contact with water.

## Features: 

 - Ore Dictionary / Tags for crafting compatibility with vanilla and other mods. 
 - Simple crafting recipe that can be crafted in personal crafting grid for on the go NoFall Action.
 - Concrete can be made from the concrete powder blocks by adding water. **Water not included.*
 - Same textures, sounds, and stack size as Vanilla counterparts. 
 - They stay were you put them. 
 - They do not fall.
